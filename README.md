# Ransomware Cyber Project

![Project Logo](project-logo.png) <!-- Replace with your project's logo or relevant image -->

A ransomware cyber project that demonstrates basic encryption and decryption processes using the AES algorithm.

## Introduction

This project showcases a simple ransomware simulation to demonstrate how ransomware encrypts and decrypts files using the AES encryption algorithm. It consists of two main components: an encryption module and a decryption module. This project is for educational purposes only and is not intended for malicious use.

## Features

- Encryption of files in a specified root folder using AES encryption.
- Decryption of encrypted files using the appropriate key and IV.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ransomware-cyberproj.git
cd ransomware-cyberproj
Open the solution in your preferred development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).

Build and run the application.

Run the encryption process by launching the application. If encryption hasn't been run before, the program will encrypt files within the specified root folder.

To simulate decryption, input valid transaction details in the UI (payment sender and recipient addresses) and click the "Check Payment" button.

Technologies
C#
.NET Framework
