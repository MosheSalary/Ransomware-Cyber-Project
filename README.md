# Ransomware Cyber Project

A ransomware simulation project that demonstrates basic encryption and decryption processes using the AES algorithm.

## Overview

This project provides a simple yet informative demonstration of ransomware functionality. It aims to illustrate the encryption and decryption procedures using the AES encryption algorithm. Please note that this project is purely educational and must not be utilized for malicious purposes.

## Features

- **Encryption:** Encrypts files within a specified root folder using the robust AES encryption algorithm.
- **Decryption:** Decrypts previously encrypted files using the appropriate key and IV.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ransomware-cyberproj.git
   cd ransomware-cyberproj
Open and Build:

Open the solution in your preferred development environment (e.g., Visual Studio) and build the application.

Encryption Process:

Run the application to initiate the encryption process. The program will encrypt files in the designated root folder.

Decryption Simulation:

Simulate decryption by providing valid transaction details in the UI (sender and recipient addresses) and clicking the "Check Payment" button.

## Technologies

C#

.NET Framework

AES Encryption Algorithm

Windows Forms for UI
